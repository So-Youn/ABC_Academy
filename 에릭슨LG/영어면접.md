  I used to very shy before entering university
  so I decided to participate in many activities.
  The most memorable experience was my Student Association.
  I planned a program of retreat to help freshman get close to seniors.
  so I have learned how to lead and care for people.
  I'm confident that my people skills will `be of great value in your company.`
