Hi, my name is soyoun yoon.

Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to be here

I'm an prospective Support Engineer who can bring passion to ELG

I majored in Electronic Engineering concentrating on Information Communication Engineering in college.

I got 2 kinds of certificates in  Engineer Information Processing and Radio Telecommunication Equipment.

They've given me opportunities to work as a Engineer Intern for Naver Data Center and KT.

During my employment at KT Access Operation Center for 9 weeks, I discovered the development of 5G equipment was the most important thing in order for various industries to develop overall.

when it comes to my primary selling points for this job, I'm really challenging and i have the ability to adapt to work through job experience in various companies 

With the experiences that I’ve mentioned so far, I will bring a positive results to ELG to secure the No.1 market share and meet the satisfaction of all the customers

Now, I’m looking forward to working for Erricson-LG
